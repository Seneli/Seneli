# Hi there 👋 My name's Seneli and welcome to my Github 🐼

I'm currently a student at Carleton University and in my free time I love to play piano 🎹, read📚, volunteer🧑‍🤝‍🧑 and code!

This year I want to organize my github, so I'm using this README to keep myself accountable.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:

* 💻 A personal website 
* ⚙️  My 3rd year project (still undecided)
* 🧵 My SYSC 3303 project using concurrency in Java 

## Here are some quick links for how to reach me:

* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seneliseneviratne/)
* email: [seneliseneviratne@cmail.carleton.ca](seneliseneviratne@cmail.carleton.ca)
