## Hello helloo 🌺 My name's Seneli and welcome to my Github 🐼

I'm currently a 3rd year at Carleton University and in my free time I love to play piano 🎹, read📚, watch anime🦊 and code!

This year I want to organize my github, so I'm using this README to keep myself accountable.

## 🌿 I’m currently working on:

* 💻 A personal website 
* ⚙️  My 3rd year project - an automated Covid Rapid Screening system with mask and body temperature detection
* 🧵 My SYSC 3303 project using concurrency in Java 

## 🌿 Here are some quick links for how to reach me:
