## Hello helloo 🌺 My name's Seneli and welcome to my Github 🐼

I'm currently a 4th year at Carleton University and in my free time I love to play piano 🎹, read📚, watch anime🦊 and learn about software!

This year I want to organize my github, so I'm using this README to keep myself accountable.

## 🌿 I’m currently working on:

* 💻 Refactoring my personal website 
* 🛡️ A tool that identify vulnerabilities at the design stage - for my capstone project
* 🚦 An exploration of using segment routing and SDN features for Green Traffic Engineering - [based on this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9844091)

## 🌿 Here are some quick links for how to reach me:

* 🌺 email: [seneliseneviratne@cmail.carleton.ca](seneliseneviratne@cmail.carleton.ca)
